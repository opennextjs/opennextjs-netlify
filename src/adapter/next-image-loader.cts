// this file is CJS because we add a `require` polyfill banner that attempt to use node:module in ESM modules
// this later cause problems because Next.js will use this file in browser context where node:module is not available
// ideally we would not add banner for this file and the we could make it ESM, but currently there is no conditional banners
// in esbuild, only workaround in form of this proof of concept https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-plugin-transform-hook
// (or rolling our own esbuild plugin for that)
